> My study of ResNet50. Implemented with Convolution and Identity Blocks, both containing Layer Skips to help with Vanishing Gradient issue. Training and Prediciton is done with hand images representing numbers.

## Install

```sh
pip install numpy h5py tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

```sh
run python -m resnet50.task

---or---

Open ResNet50.ipynb and run cells to train and predict from the included dataset of hand images representing numbers.
```
